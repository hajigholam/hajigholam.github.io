## Welcome to my personal website!
  
I offer over three years of designing and developing advanced machine-learning models using Python, alongside proficiency in statistical analysis using R and tutoring experience in time-series forecasting in SAS. Additionally, I possess a strong command of SQL, Power BI, and Tableau with hands-on experience in databases, cloud services/platforms version control, and MLops for data
pipelines and model deployment.

Personality-wise, I thrive on challenges, approach tasks with a disciplined mindset, and am self-motivated and driven by a passion for solving problems and achieving results.
