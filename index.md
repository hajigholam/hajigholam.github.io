## Welcome to my personal website!
  
As a self-motivated final-year student, I offer over three years of experience in designing and developing advanced Machine
Learning models using Python, alongside proficiency in statistical analysis using R. Additionally, I possess a strong command of
SQL, with hands-on experience in databases, cloud services and platforms, Dataiku, Git, MLops, and CICD pipelines for data
pipelines and model deployment. I am actively seeking a full-time role in Canada to leverage my expertise and contribute to
data-driven innovation.
