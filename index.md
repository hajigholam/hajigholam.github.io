## Welcome to my personal website!
  
As a self-motivated learner, I offer over three years of experience in designing and developing advanced Machine
Learning models using Python, alongside proficiency in statistical analysis using R. Additionally, I possess a strong command of
SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, with hands-on experience in databases, cloud services and platforms, version control, MLops, and CICD for data
pipelines and model deployment.
