I am a final-year master's student in **Business Analytics at Concordia University**, and my journey in the world of data and analytics has been nothing short of exciting. Throughout my academic pursuits, I have delved deep into the realms of data science and artificial intelligence, honing my skills as a researcher and practitioner. My passion for **data-driven decision-making** led me to work as a **research assistant** in these fields during my master's program.

In addition to my research roles, my time as both a **teaching assistant** and facilitator for various courses across different departments at Concordia University has been instrumental in my personal and professional development. These experiences have not only expanded my horizons within diverse academic disciplines but have also been a crucible for refining crucial soft skills such as **leadership** that are highly valued in the industry job market.

My expertise spans various domains within data analytics, including **statistical modeling, statistical learning, machine learning**, and **deep learning**, all implemented using **Python** and **R**. I am comfortable navigating relational database management systems and utilizing **SQL** for data manipulation. My toolkit also includes **SAS** and **SAS Viya**, along with proficiency in data visualization tools like **Microsoft Power BI** and **Tableau** and familiarity with cloud computing services like **AWS**.

Prior to my current academic journey, I pursued an **MBA** with a focus on supply chain and operations. Drawing upon my background as an engineer, I approached challenges with an analytical mind and a relentless passion for problem-solving. During this time, I had the opportunity to intern at a leading insurance company, where I developed a **decision support system** that optimized complex processes and improved efficiency. This experience not only deepened my appreciation for data-driven solutions but also showcased my ability to apply analytical thinking to real-world business challenges. My educational foundation lies in **Mechanical Engineering**, with a bachelor's degree, and I had the privilege of interning in the automotive industry. These experiences have instilled in me a strong foundation in analytical problem-solving, a skill I continue to bring to my work in the field of data analytics.

As I embark on the next phase of my career, I am eagerly seeking opportunities in roles such as **Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence, Risk Analyst, Data Modeler**, and other related quantitative fields. I am excited to bring my diverse skill set, passion for problem-solving, and dedication to fostering accessible learning to drive meaningful impact in the business world.
