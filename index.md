## Assistant Professor at McGill University/University of Montréal/MILA
I am an Assistant Professor of the School of Computer Science at McGill University, and Adjunct professor at University Montréal. I am a core faculty member at MILA (Quebec Institute for Learning Algorithms) and hold Canada CIFAR AI chair.

Prior to this, I hold a similar position at HEC Montréal (U. Montreal's business school) and from 2018-2020, I was a a post-doctoral IVADO fellow at University of Montreal and MILA working on fairness-aware sequential decision making under uncertainty with [professor Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/) and [professor Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/gendreau-michel). From 2017-2018, I was a postdoc researcher of the Statistical Relational Learning Group (LINQS) of [professor Lise Getoor](https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu/home) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer science from KU Leuven and Ghent University in 2017 with a dissertation on user modeling in social media under the supervision of [professor Martine de Cock](http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/) and [professor Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/). During my PhD, I was a visiting scholar at UCLA, University of Washington, Tacoma, Tsinguha University, and Microsoft research, Redmond. 

In 2021, I won Google Scholar Award and Facebook Research Award and was named one of the Rising Stars, a list of 20 promising new diverse talents in AI Ethics.
