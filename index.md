## Welcome to my website!

With a diverse background spanning the automotive, energy, real estate, construction, and education industries, I bring a wealth of cross-sector knowledge and adaptability. My career has evolved to focus on project management, complex system modeling, forecasting, data analytics, business intelligence, and data science, allowing me to leverage this multifaceted experience to deliver insightful and data-driven solutions that drive business success.
  
Technically, I offer over three years of designing and developing advanced machine-learning models using Python, proficiency in statistical analysis using R, and tutoring experience in time-series forecasting in SAS. Additionally, I possess a strong command of SQL, Power BI, and Tableau with hands-on experience in databases, cloud services/platforms version control, and MLops for data
pipelines and model deployment.

Personality-wise, I thrive on challenges, approach tasks with a disciplined mindset, and am self-motivated and driven by a passion for solving problems and achieving results.
