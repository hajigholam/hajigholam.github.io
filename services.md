I firmly believe in the profound value of giving back to the community from which I have drawn so much inspiration and support. Volunteering has become a cornerstone of my life, allowing me to contribute to the betterment of my community in meaningful ways. This commitment stems from a deep-seated belief that one's success should be intertwined with the upliftment of the community that has played a pivotal role in shaping one's journey. Through volunteering, I find purpose in creating positive change, offering my skills and time to make a lasting impact. It is not only a personal responsibility but also a source of immense fulfillment to see the positive ripple effect that my contributions have on the lives of others in my community.

- Admin at "How to Apply to Business Schools" since 2021
“How to Apply to Business Schools” is a social media non-profit group with more than 2000 Iranian who are interested to pursue their academic journey in a business field abroad. Other admins and I help members by providing resources, mentorship services, professional advice, and conducting workshops. I was the main speaker of the last workshop held on May 2021.
